> ** I had been using macOS Sonoma 14.5, and the latest Intel Pre-Release WiFi drivers only support up to 14.4. It is really buggy. If you want stable WiFi and Bluetooth, I suggest you should install macOS Ventura

> *! DRM would not work on Integrated Intel GPUs. Descrete GPUs are required for DRM to work.
Apple Music can still play songs, but not with Dolby Atmos or the fancy Hi-Res Lossless Audio Quality. Apple TV can play videos just fine.
